# Real-Time Notifications System

## Overview

The real-time notification system has been implemented to provide instant notifications to users when they receive likes, comments, or other interactions, similar to how messages work in real-time.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **Socket Service** (`src/lib/socket.ts`)
   - Manages WebSocket connections using Socket.IO
   - Handles connection, disconnection, and error events
   - Provides fallback to mock socket if connection fails

2. **Real-time Notification Service** (`src/lib/realtimeNotificationService.ts`)
   - Manages real-time notification subscriptions
   - Handles incoming notifications and unread count updates
   - Provides methods for marking notifications as read

3. **Updated Components**
   - `NotificationDropdown.tsx` - Real-time notification dropdown
   - `NotificationsPage.tsx` - Full notifications page with real-time updates

### Backend Implementation

1. **Socket.IO Server** (`backend/server.js`)
   - Integrated Socket.IO with Express server
   - Handles user connections and room management
   - Emits real-time events for notifications

2. **Real-time Events**
   - `new_notification` - Emitted when a new notification is created
   - `unread_count_update` - Emitted when unread count changes
   - `join_notifications` - User joins their notification room
   - `get_unread_count` - Request current unread count
   - `mark_notification_read` - Mark single notification as read
   - `mark_all_notifications_read` - Mark all notifications as read

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Setup
- When a user logs in, the frontend initializes the Socket.IO connection
- User joins their personal notification room (`notifications_${userId}`)
- Frontend subscribes to notification and unread count events

### 2. Real-time Updates
- When someone likes or comments on a user's post:
  - Backend creates notification in database
  - Emits `new_notification` event to the post owner's room
  - Updates unread count and emits `unread_count_update`
- Frontend receives events and updates UI immediately

### 3. User Interactions
- When user clicks on notification:
  - Emits `mark_notification_read` event
  - Updates local state immediately
  - Also calls REST API as backup
- When user marks all as read:
  - Emits `mark_all_notifications_read` event
  - Updates unread count to 0

### 4. Fallback System
- Polling every 60 seconds as backup (reduced from 30 seconds)
- REST API calls as secondary backup
- Graceful degradation if WebSocket fails

## Features

### ✅ **Real-time Notifications**
- Instant notification delivery
- Live unread count updates
- Toast notifications for new items

### ✅ **Reliable Delivery**
- WebSocket primary transport
- Polling fallback every 60 seconds
- REST API backup for critical operations

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Immediate UI updates
- No page refresh needed
- Smooth animations and transitions

### ✅ **Error Handling**
- Connection error handling
- Automatic reconnection
- Graceful fallback to polling

## Testing

To test the real-time notification system:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test scenarios**:
   - Like a post from one user account
   - Comment on a post from another user account
   - Check that notifications appear instantly in the target user's notification dropdown
   - Verify unread count updates in real-time

## Deployment Notes

### Frontend
- Socket.IO client automatically connects to deployed backend
- No additional configuration needed
- Fallback system ensures reliability

### Backend
- Socket.IO server runs on same port as Express server
- CORS configured for production domains
- WebSocket connections work with load balancers

## Performance Considerations

- **Connection Management**: Users only connect to their own notification room
- **Event Efficiency**: Only relevant users receive notifications
- **Fallback Polling**: Reduced frequency (60s) since real-time is primary
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Push notifications for mobile
- [ ] Notification preferences (email, push, in-app)
- [ ] Notification categories and filtering
- [ ] Read receipts and delivery status
- [ ] Notification history and search
